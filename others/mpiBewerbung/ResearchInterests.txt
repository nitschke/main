In general, I am interested in real world problems and to bring them into a mathematical context. This includes the choice of an appropriate algebraic structure, the development of the solution algorithm and its implementation, testing, evaluating and comparing results and, if necessary, to create an end-user interface.
Because of my past research, I am very interested in fluid mechanics and problems in curved spaces. But I would also look forward to new scientific challenges.
