  abstract={A computational study of discrete 'cell-centre' approaches to modelling the evolution of a collection of cells is undertaken. The study focuses on the mechanical aspects of the tissue, in order to separate the passive mechanical response of the model from active effects such as cell-growth and cell division. Issues which arise when implementing these models are described, and a series of numerical mechanical experiments is performed. It is shown that discrete tissues modelled this way typically exhibit elastic–plastic behaviour under slow compression, and act as a brittle linear elastic solid under slow tension. Both overlapping spheres and Voronoi–tessellation-based models are examined, and the effect of different cell–cell interaction force laws on the bulk mechanical properties of the tissue is determined. This correspondence allows parameters in the cell-based model to be chosen to be compatible with bulk tissue measurements.}

Abstract = {The minimum covering sphere problem, with applications in location theory, is that of finding the sphere of smallest radius which encloses a set of points in E[sup n]. For a finite set of points, it is shown that the Wolfe dual is equivalent to a particular quadratic programming problem and that converse duality holds. A finite decomposition algorithm, based on the Simplex method of quadratic programming, is developed for which computer storage requirements are independent of the number of points and computing time is approximately linear in the number of points.

@article{arakawa,
    abstract = {{A finite difference scheme is developed for numerical integration of the nondivergent barotropic vorticity equation with an icosahedral-hexagonal grid covering the sphere. The grid is made by dividing the 20 triangular faces of an icosahedron into smaller triangles, the vertices of which are the grid points. Each grid point is surrounded by six neighboring points, except the 12 vertices of the icosahedron which are surrounded by five points. The difference scheme for the advection of vorticity exactly conserves total vorticity, total square vorticity, and total kinetic energy. A numerical test is made, with a stationary Neamtan wave as the initial condition, by integrating over 8 days with 1-hr. time steps and a grid of 1002 points for the sphere. There is practically no distortion of the waves over the 8 days, but there is a phase displacement error of about 1\&\#176; of long. per day toward the west.U.C.L.A.
