Example:
1. load sym.pvd, containing 188 timesteps of the simulation, where only every 10th timestep was written and the last
2. load dat.csv, containing all 1863 timesteps with the value of interest "Full"
3. use "TableToPoints" filter on dat.csv. For the (X|Y|Z) columns use anything but "Full"
4. use "AppendAttributes" on sym.pvd and TableToPoints
5. use "PythonAnnonation" on PointData with something like ""Energy: %011.7f"%Full[min([t_index*10,1862])]" as expression

Hints:
- use leading zeros to prevent flickering annonations in animations
